# YASPA stands for Yet Another Simple Page Application

This simple one is about a fake puzzle brand called "Puzzlify" and approved by Beyonc√© because why not.

This has been deployed on surge for the fun of it, you can find it here: https://yaspa.surge.sh

# stack

Still exploring the basics because I'm still learning a few things along the way, so the stack is pretty simple: html & css. Tried to add a little bit of complexity to it.

# what i thought would happen

- enjoying flexing literally everything
- enjoying the result
- exploring a bit more css

# what actually happened

- flexbox FTW (i should explore grid sometime soon)
- did not struggle with html at all (im not surprised but it's still enjoyable)
- definitely enjoyed playing with gradients and animations
- i like how the nav bar looks

# what i learned from this project 

- learned how to use before and after pseudo css properties as well as transform and transition which was not a walk in the park
